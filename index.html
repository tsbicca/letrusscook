<h2 style="text-align: center;">DEAR PETE CARROLL AND SKYBOX SHOTTIE,</h2>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">
Halfway through the season and head chef Russ is cooking up a fine meal!  Sous chef Lockett is slicing and dicing defenses.  Chef de Partie Metcalf has grown beyond his three cone limitations.  Saucier Moore is keeping guests on their toes with his aerial performance.  But weâ€™re only through the early bird rush.    We have a whole lot more service to get through before Chef Russ leaves with a James beard award.  As the front of the house you must keep your eye on one thing and one thing only.  You must LET RUSS COOK!</h1>
